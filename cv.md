## About me
I became interested in web development more than 5 years ago, but I only started taking it seriously in 2024. This field fascinates me both as a hobby and as a potential future profession. I really enjoy exploring the world of development because no matter where you look, you're always learning something new. It's not uncommon for me to get very frustrated when things don't work out, but at the same time, I'm incredibly happy when they finally do. I don't think I'm unique in this regard, but I just wanted to say that I really enjoy learning about development.
